Description: A set of functions that make spectroscopic
    data processing easier and faster. It is intended for processing several
    spectra of samples with similar composition (tens to hundreds of spectra). It
    compiles spectroscopy data files, produces standardized and second derivative
    spectra, finds peaks and allows to select the most significant ones based on
    the second derivative/absorbance sum spectrum. It also provides functions for
    graphic evaluation of the outputs.
